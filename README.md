Here is a mini 3D Engine I made a while back (in 2019), based on some sort of false Ray Tracing.

Resolution is absolutely disgusting, there's not really any possibility to import 3D models like .obj, and there's no possibility to add materials on 3D Objects.
But at least, there's some kind of 3D here that we can see. I made a little project with this engine to see if it would be of any use, and it seemed to be !
